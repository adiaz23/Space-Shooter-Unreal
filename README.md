# Space Shooter 

I developed a Space Shooter using Unreal Engine 5 where the player takes the control of a space ship with the objective of destroying as many enemies they can. The game is compatible with Windows machines.

## Mechanics

The game mechanics are:

1. Continuous progress in an infinite background
2. Space ship controlled by the player.
3. Three types of enemies.
4. A HUD that shows the player's lives, progress, and the number of enemies killed.
5. Two power ups: Space Ship Velocity Speed Up(Blue) and Space Ship Fire Rate up(Yellow).
6. Different sounds effects for shooting, destroying, and collecting power ups.

## Controllers

The Space ship can be controlled using either the arrow keys or the WASD keys. To shoot, press the spacebar. To quit the game, press Escape
